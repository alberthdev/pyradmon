Example gsidiag_bin2txt.nl:

 &NLCONFIG
  debug = .false.,
  npred_read = 7,
  sst_ret = .false.,
  iversion = -9999,
  append_txt_suffix = .false.,
/

Options:

- debug = .true. or .false. (default = .false)
--- Simply prints out a lot more (and probably excessive) information

- npred_read = 7
--- Specify the number of predictors to read (default = 7)

- sst_ret (default = .false.)
--- this logical is set for the read_diag.  Unless you know you use it, you 
       probably don't need to set it.

- iversion (default = -9999, essentially not set/passed forward to read_diag)
--- It may be necessary to override the iversion number.  This has been the 
       case at GMAO since roughly local GEOSadas version 5.12. 

- append_txt_suffix (default = .false.)
--- At GMAO, the diag files are typically:
         - experiment.diag_inst_plat_ges.YYYYMMDD_HHz.bin
         - experiment.diag_inst_plat_anl.YYYYMMDD_HHz.bin
       if this flag is false, it replaces .bin with .txt.  If it is set, it 
       appends infile with a .txt suffix

gsidiag
=======

This folder contains the gsidiag_bin2txt source and executables necessary 
for running the pyradmon routines.  Over time, this may contain more 
versions.  As of this writing, it contains a current version (gsidiag_bin2txt),
which can be compiled with a GEOSadas version 5.12 and 5.13 read_diags.f90, 
and a version that is retrofitted to GEOSadas version 5.11 (gsidiag_bin2txt.511).

Further documentation is available in each directory's README.md.

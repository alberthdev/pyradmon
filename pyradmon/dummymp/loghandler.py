    This class is a custom logging handler to allow spawned processes
    (from multiprocessing) to log without any issues. This works by
    intercepting emitted log records, and sending them via queue to the
    master process. The master process will process each record and call
    logging.handle() to emit the logging record at the master process
    level.
    
    Note that this class can be used as a general multiprocess logging
    handler simply by removing the int_pid attribute.
    
    Attributes:
        queue: The Queue object to forward logging records to.
        int_pid: The internal PID used to reference the process.

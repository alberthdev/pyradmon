def _runner(process_id, dummymp_queue, func, *args, **kwargs):
    """Multiprocess function wrapper for running a function given args.
    
    This function wraps an existing function with its args, and allows 
    for additional fields related to multiprocessing. In particular, 
    the internal process ID and the multiprocessing Queue object are 
    added to facilitate communication between the subprocess and the 
    master process.
    
    Args:
        process_id (int): The internal process ID for the particular
            process. This is NOT the actual system process ID.
        dummymp_queue (multiprocessing.Queue): The Queue object that 
            the process should send data to. The Queue should be a 
            Queue made specifically for this process.
        func (function): The function that the process should call.
        *args: The arguments that should be passed to the function.
    
    Returns:
        Nothing... but the function will periodically send messages to
        the Queue in this format:
            [ [ DUMMYMP_MSG_TYPE_ID, SYSTEM_PID, INTERNAL_ID ], DATA... ]
        
        Possible DUMMYMP_MSG_TYPE_IDs include:
            DUMMYMP_LOG_ID: ID for log records. The entire format is:
                
                [ [ DUMMYMP_LOG_ID, SYSTEM_PID, INTERNAL_ID ], LOGGING_RECORD ]
                
                When a message of this type is sent, the corresponding
                LOGGING_RECORD is emitted at the master process level.
                (In plain English: the logging message gets sent to the
                main process, and is printed from there.)
            
            DUMMYMP_RET_ID: ID for return data. The entire format is:
                
                [ [ DUMMYMP_RET_ID, SYSTEM_PID, INTERNAL_ID ], RETURN_VAL ]
                
                When a message of this type is sent, the RETURN_VAL is 
                stored in a dictionary at the master process level to 
                archive the return value from this process for future 
                retrieval. (In plain English: the return values are 
                sent to the main process, and are stored in a 
                dictionary for reference.)

Introduction
============
Included here are some scripts to wrap around the pyradmon package.  The driver script, pyradmon_driver.csh, can run the package for a time range for all instruments.  To run:

./pyradmon_driver.csh pyradmon_driver.example.rc 20140601 20140814

Look at e5130_fp.rc and pyradmon_driver.example.rc to see how to create the necessary rc file.

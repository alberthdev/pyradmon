Getting Started - User
***********************************************************************

As a user of **PyRadmon**, you probably want to use **PyRadmon** for
creating radiance monitoring plots. This guide will help you achieve
that!

This guide is for running and using **PyRadmon** to search, extract, 
and plot data.

Getting PyRadmon
================
If you haven't already done so, get PyRadmon now!

Speedy Start
============
The first thing you probably want to do is make a plot, right? It's 
really simple!

#. First, create a new file called myconfig.yaml. Copy the following text into
   this new file:
   
   .. code-block:: yaml
   
    config:
      data_path_format: PATH_TO_PROCESSED_TXT_FILES
      data_step: anl|ges
      data_start_date: YYYY-MM-DD HHz
      data_end_date: YYYY-MM-DD HHz
      experiment_id: EXPERIMENT_ID
      data_instrument_sat: INSTRUMENT_SAT
      data_channels: DATA_CHANNEL_RANGE
      
   Replace ``YYYY-MM-DD HHz`` in ``data_start_date`` with your desired data
   start date, with the format given above. (``YYYY-MM-DD HHz``)
   
   **Note that all digits must be filled!** (For instance, if month is ``5``,
   it should be written as ``05``.)
   
   Replace ``YYYY-MM-DD HHz`` in ``data_end_date`` with your desired data end
   date, with the format given above. (``YYYY-MM-DD HHz``) Again, the above
   rules apply!
   
   Now replace ``INSTRUMENT_SAT`` in ``data_instrument_sat`` with the
   instrument/satellite ID, and ``EXPERIMENT_ID`` in ``experiment_id`` with the
   experiment ID.
   
   Now replace ``DATA_CHANNEL_RANGE`` with a numeric channel range and/or
   comma-seperated channel/channel range. An example::
   
    1,2-5,10
    1-10
    1,3,5
    1
